# Web Application Cookies Not Marked HttpOnly

### Severity: High

## Issue Description

The remote web application sets various cookies throughout a user's unauthenticated and authenticated session. However, one or more of those cookies are not marked 'HttpOnly', meaning that a malicious client-side script, such as JavaScript, could read them. The HttpOnly flag is a security mechanism to protect against cross-site scripting attacks, which was proposed by Microsoft and initially implemented in Internet Explorer. All modern browsers now support it.  
  
This plugin detects all general cookies missing the HttpOnly cookie flag, whereas plugin 48432 (Web Application Session Cookies Not Marked HttpOnly) will only detect session cookies from an authenticated session missing the HttpOnly cookie flag.


## Risk Rating

-   Risk: High
    
-   Difficulty to Exploit: Medium
    
-   Authentication : No

## Affected Target

-     http://52.66.188.78:31337/


## Proof Of Concept

The following cookie does not set the HttpOnly cookie flag :

## Business Impact

1.  **Data Theft**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to steal sensitive information stored in cookies, such as session tokens, user credentials, or personal data. This stolen information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes.
    
2.  **Session Hijacking**: By stealing session cookies, attackers can hijack users' sessions and impersonate them on the website. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive accounts, manipulation of user data, or fraudulent transactions.
    
3.  **Loss of Customer Trust**: Security vulnerabilities erode trust in the affected business. If customers become aware of the vulnerability and its consequences, they may lose confidence in the security of the website and be hesitant to engage with it in the future. This can result in loss of customers and damage to the brand's reputation.
    
4.  **Regulatory Compliance Issues**: Depending on the nature of the data involved and the jurisdiction in which the business operates, the vulnerability may lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). This can result in fines, legal action, and further reputational damage.
    
5.  **Financial Loss**: Remediation efforts, such as patching the vulnerability, conducting security audits, and addressing any legal or regulatory consequences, can incur significant costs for the business. Additionally, if the vulnerability leads to data breaches or other security incidents, the business may face financial losses due to legal settlements, fines, and loss of revenue.

## Recommendations and Remediation

1.  **Set HttpOnly Flag**: Ensure that all cookies containing sensitive information are marked with the HttpOnly flag. This prevents client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, from accessing the cookie values, thereby mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
    
2.  **Secure Cookie Attributes**: Consider setting other cookie attributes such as `Secure` (to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS) and `SameSite` (to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks).
    
3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This includes validating and sanitizing user input on both the client and server sides.
    
4.  **Encode Output**: Encode output data to prevent malicious scripts from being executed when echoed back to users. Use proper encoding functions (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping) based on the context where the data is being output.
    
5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by specifying trusted sources of content (such as scripts, stylesheets, and images) that the browser should consider valid.
    
6.  **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of your web application to identify and address security weaknesses, including missing HttpOnly flags and XSS vulnerabilities.
    
7.  **Security Awareness Training**: Provide security awareness training to developers and stakeholders to educate them about common web security risks, such as XSS, and best practices for preventing and mitigating them.
    
8.  **Use Security Tools**: Utilize security tools and scanners to automatically detect and identify vulnerabilities in your web application, including missing HttpOnly flags and XSS vulnerabilities.
    
9.  **Update Libraries and Frameworks**: Keep your web application dependencies, including libraries and frameworks, up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches and fixes.
    
10.  **Bug Bounty Program**: Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to report vulnerabilities in your web application, including missing HttpOnly flags and XSS issues, in exchange for rewards or recognition.
